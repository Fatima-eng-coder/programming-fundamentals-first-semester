# ðŸ“˜ Assignment 2 - Java Menu Driven Program

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This Assignment is a **menu-driven Java console application** developed as part of **Assignment 2**.  
It provides an interactive interface where the user can choose from **six different problems**, each implemented as a separate feature.  
The program uses **color-coded outputs, animations, and menus** for a better user experience.

## ðŸ›  Features
The main menu provides the following options:

1. **SSN Validation**  
   - Validates if the entered Social Security Number matches the format `DDD-DD-DDDD`.

2. **Major and Status Analyzer**  
   - Takes two characters as input:  
     - First character â†’ Major (`M` = Mathematics, `C` = Computer Science, `I` = IT)  
     - Second character â†’ Year (`1` = Freshman, `2` = Sophomore, `3` = Junior, `4` = Senior)  
   - Displays the corresponding **major and year status**.

3. **Palindrome Checker**  
   - Checks if a given string is a **palindrome** (reads the same forwards and backwards).

4. **Decimal to Binary Converter**  
   - Converts a given **decimal number** to its **binary representation**.

5. **Java Fundamentals Quiz**  
   - A short **5-question quiz** about basic Java concepts.  
   - Displays your score and feedback.

6. **Prime Number Checker**  
   - Checks if the entered number is a **prime**.

0. **Exit Program**  
   - Displays a **thank-you screen** and exits gracefully.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with several important **Java programming concepts**:

- **Menu-driven programs** using loops and switch-case statements.  
- **Input validation** with `Scanner` to handle both valid and invalid inputs.  
- **String operations** such as matching patterns (Regex), reversing strings, and checking palindromes.  
- **Control structures** like `if-else`, `switch`, and iterative loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).  
- **Basic algorithms** including decimal-to-binary conversion and prime number checking.  
- **Modular programming** by organizing different features into separate methods.  
- **User interaction improvements** using colors, Unicode characters, and slow-print effects for better readability.  

This assignment helped me **strengthen my problem-solving skills in Java**, improve my understanding of **core programming logic**, and practice building a more **user-friendly console application**.
